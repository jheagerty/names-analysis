# names-analysis
analysis for naming babies


## DONE
- get data (ONS names)
- get data (USA names)
- get data (british embeddings)
- get data (google ngrams of names)
- 1996 vs 2020 (ONS names - biggest and fastest names rising and falling)
- my friend Noah is pissed his name is now incredibly popular (when did it start rising and what might have caused this?)
- USA vs UK cosine similarity over time (our names are getting more similar)
- explore name embeddings projected against semantic axes of your choice
- find most semantically similar names to one of your choice
- convert names to phonemes
- simple plot of ngrams trajectories of names

## TODO
- add latest year of ONS data
- add google trends scrape
- try standard internet-wide embeddings
- add analysis (name trajectory similarity - see pudding.cool)
- make a pretty interactive dashboard (plotly dash? streamlit?)
- make a pretty interactive dashboard (pick name, show lines for ONS, google ngram, google trends. Index together to be roughly comparable. At a name by name level, or baselined overall?)
- make a pretty interactive dashboard (conver and tidy the embedding explorer)
- make a pretty interactive dashboard (most similar names explorer)
- make a pretty interactive dashboard (filter the ONS data - biggest and fastest names rising and falling)
